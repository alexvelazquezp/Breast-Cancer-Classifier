# Breast-Cancer-Classifier
Using a dataset with more than 500 previous samples, in this notebook we are going to build a model for the detection of breast cancer. To achieve the most efficient model, we are going to analyze 4 different models based on logistic regression, K-Nearest neighbor, decision trees and support vector machines. Finally, we will compare its performance and accuracy.
